Comments:
It's my first project to be ever published on GitHub.
So I made this project to practise coding on c++.
Hope you don't find this as a last piece of shit.

Description:
- the calculator can initialize such arithmetical operations as *,/,+,-,%
- works in a loop
- checks division by 0
- uses switch case
- on the end prints a result of operations
